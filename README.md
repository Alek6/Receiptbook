# Receiptbook

## The Baseline
An organized place were to create, order, personalize and save your most important receipts of everyday-life expenses.
Receipts will be represented like cards (like in real-life paper form), and they will contain all the default informations.

## The further development and ideas

The idea is to create a `Trello` style of cards which could be organized by the user by categories, colors, and tags. This permits
the build of a well organized world of expenses receipts.

Another improvement for receipt organization by categories it can be the presence of a left panel with the list of categories.

## Branching Strategy and Prototype Pattern
In this project I will follow the **Prototype** pattern and best practices, in particular I will adopt the Guthub blackborad kaban cards to take 
track of the project evolvement, track and issues.

The applied branching strategy is feature-oriented so we have a branch for every single task and the main/static branches are `master`, `dev` and `ui` following
the standards that we can find in any enterprise working environment.
Finally any merge will be made by a /pull request/.

## Naming conventions and best practices

We adopt:

- [kebab-case](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab_case) for file, folder and branch names
- [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for functions and methods
- [lowerCamelCase](https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_conventions.asp) for variables
  accordingly with the native project setup.

I will try to split the script on multiple files and use the object oriented paradigm, where possible.
